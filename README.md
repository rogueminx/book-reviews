## Fan Site
### Create a collective contribution fan site for a genre of music, movies, art or books. It will be a place that users can come to explore the genre, share their opinions and filter the contents based on various properties.

- [x] As a user, I want to add a new item to the site so I can share a work that I have experienced.
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete works on the site so that information is correct and current.
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see all works alphabetically by name.
- [ ] As a user, I want to see all works in order by creation date.
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to see links on the homepage to the most popular filtered lists (for example: Most popular subgenres)
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to view a featured work on the home page that randomly changes each time I visit.
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to view each work individually to see all of its details.
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to give each work a rating and see the average rating of all works. (partial)
- [x] As a user, I want to be able to write my own opinion/review of each work.
Practicing with Scopes
- [ ] As a user, I want to see all reviews written in the last week.
- [ ] As a user, I want to see which items have the most reviews.
- [ ] As a user, I want to see which users have written the most reviews.
- [ ] As a user, I want to look at other users and see which works they've reviewed.
- [ ] As a user, I want to see all of the most recent works that  don't have a review so I can be the first to review them.

### Further Exploration
As a user, I want to be able to search for works by keywords. (Try the textacular gem for text searches).
As a user, I want to be able to see all of the returned values of a search on several pages. (Try the Kaminari or will_paginate gems for pagination.)
